‚óè Data Analysis & Statistical Modeling: 

   -Analyzed Electronic Health Records using Python and statistical methods, yielding fundamental insights that enhanced medical research and patient care. 
   
   -Identified predictors of symptom reporting agreement between patients and providers using deep learning and statistical techniques.
   
‚óè Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Large Language Model (LLM): 

   -Collaborated closely with the research teams to develop an embeddings-augmented NLP system.
   
   -Understanding the language in clinical notes in the electronic health records (EHR) system using NLP techniques and text analysis. 
   
   -Developing and comparing a pre-trained language model (like Bio-Clinical BERT and GPT) on customized EHRs to predict 13 cancer symptoms and Palliative care.
   
   -Design specific prompts to guide GPT-4 in adapting to cancer symptom prediction and palliative care tasks.
   
‚óè Mobile Application Development with AI Techniques: 

   -Contributed to developing the OASIS (Oncology Associated Symptoms & Individualized Strategies) mobile app, a tool designed to help people with cancer.
   
   -Collaborated with colleagues to develop deep-learning algorithms for the app's recommendation system, predicting 14 cancer symptoms in over 18,000 patients.
   
‚óè	Assisted in A/B testing the OASIS prototype on 100 patients, assessing its real-world efficacy and user experience.

Other Project: 

   -Collaborated with a team to extract web article content, develop a sentiment classifier, and perform cluster and topic analysis to identify prevalent themes.
   
   -Worked with a team to leverage Python-based tools and algorithms to enhance and innovate demand forecasting methodologies.
   
   -Developed a heart disease classification AI system using traditional machine learning models.
